## Mathhub.info
This project is the Drupal implementation of the MathHub system 
available at [MathHub.info](http://mathhub.info). 
It is based on the [planetary system](https://github.com/KWARC/planetary).

## Dependencies
Other than the usual Drupal/Planetary dependencies a MathHub installation requires: 
* A running MMT instance
* CleanURL configured and enabled (for MMT-like URIs)
* the lmh tool (see [here](http://mathhub.info/help/lmh))
* Archives to be served configured in the interface (see configuration below)
* (Optionally) a [MathWebSearch](http://search.mathweb.org) instance running

## Configuration
